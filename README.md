Overview:
This is an app that allows a user to look up recipes, then save and remove them from a list.
All calls from this website are to the back end that I created, but then that back end communitcates with the edamam api to get the resipes, and the amazon fresh api for a shopping feature that is not built out yet.
Token authentication is used to verify a user, and maintain their list of prefered recipes.


technologies used:
Html, Bootstrap, Javascript, Ajax, and Handlebars


Unsolved Problems:
The biggest thing to work on is rebuilding the front end in react.
With this project, and the limited time we had, I made a decision to build the front end with methods that I already knew, so I could focus on building a more complicated back end.
I did this with my deadline in mind and understanding scope. I would have liked to have built this in react from the start, however, with having to deliver a product by a certain day, I had to look at the scope of the project, and decide what is important at the time.

I would like the page to look nicer. I think it is relatively clean, but fairly unremarkable, as I spent more of my time working on functional features, instead of styling. Again, this was mostly done with knowing that as soon as the deadline past, I would be rebuilding the front end using different technoology.

Planning Proccess:
My planning proccess was first Identifying what I wanted the user to be able to do.
  1. Look up recipes
  2. Save recipes to a list
  3. Remove recipes from a list
  4. Buy ingredients for the dishes (didn't get there yet)
I then thought about how I wanterd each step to present itself when completed
  1. After looking up the recipes, I wanted to the user to be able to see all the recipes that matched that search
  2. I wanted the user to be able to save the recipe directly from the recipe with just the click of a button
  3. I wanted the user to be able to see the details of the recipes they saved, just like they would see the results of a search
  4. I wanted the user to be able to remove that recipe from the list with just the click of a button, just like they saved it
  5. I then wanted the user to see that list updated to see an accurate reflection of what their list is currently.
I then gradually worked down this list, displaying the information as I got it from
